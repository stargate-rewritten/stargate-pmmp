## Description
Stargate-Bukkit is the original MineCraft portal plugin; it existed for as long as MineCraft server modding has been feasible!

## History
Originally conceived and written by Dinnerbone, this project is now maintained by [several individual developers](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Sponge/graphs/contributors).

In 2024 [Stargate-Rewritten](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/Stargate-Bukkit), by Thorinwasher and EpicKnarvik97, is slated to be ported to the PocketMine ecosystem.<br>
When that port is available, this repository will be used to host it.
